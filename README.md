### Learning Git and intelliJ connections

#### Stream2Learn on YouTube
Following this channel's Git/GitHub tutorial on connecting to IntelliJ, since my course hasn't gotten to this point. 

The [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfYZvcP0Muo&list=PL-13q2cAP-nYDf3ERqumS65wrc6RXdKrV) is from user [Stream2Learn](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjO8Jq2sdpuI134axhMp0Fg).
 
The user is [Ashwin Sakthi](https://github.com/ashwinsakthi) here on GitHub.

###### As a side note, Terminal shortcuts that work in Visual Studio Code seem to work in IntelliJ's terminal as well. In particular:
```java
* <git add .>
* <git commit -m "message goes here">
* <git push>
```
